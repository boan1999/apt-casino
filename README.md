# APT-Casino -  Real-Time GambleFi as a Decentralized Probabilistic Compute Layer on Solana and Aptos

**Live:** [https://aptcasino.fun](https://aptcasino.fun) · **Litepaper:** [https://aptcasino.fun/litepaper](https://aptcasino.fun/litepaper)

A couple of days back, I was was on etherscan exploring some transactions and saw an advertisement of [https://stake.com/](url) which was giving 200% bonus on first deposit, I deposited 120 USDT into stake.com they gave 360 USDT as total balance in their controlled custodial wallet and when I started playing casino games I was shocked to see that I was only able to play with $1 per game and was unable to increase the betting amount beyond $1 coz and when I tried to explore and play other games on the platform the issue was persisting, I reached the customer support and got to know that this platform has cheated him under the name of wager limits as I was using the bonus scheme of 200%.

When I asked the customer support to withdraw money they showed a rule list of wager limit, which said that if I wanted to withdraw the deposited amount, then I have to play $12,300 worth of gameplay and this was a big shock for me, as I was explained a maths logic by their live support. Thereby, In the hope of getting the deposited money back, I played the different games of stake.com like roulette, mines, spin wheel, etc, the entire night and lost all the money.

I was very annoyed of that's how APT-Casino was born, which is a combination of gamefi and defi all in one platform where new web3 users can play games, perform gambling, but have a safe, secure, transparent platform that does not scam any of their users. Also, I wanted to address common issues in traditional gambling platforms.

## Problems

The traditional online gambling industry is plagued by several issues, including:
- **Unfair Game Outcomes:** 99% of platforms manipulate game results, leading to unfair play.

- **High Fees:** Users face exorbitant fees for deposits, withdrawals, and gameplay.

- **Restrictive Withdrawal Policies:** Withdrawal limits and conditions often prevent users from accessing their funds.

- **Bonus Drawbacks:** Misleading bonus schemes trap users with unrealistic wagering requirements.

- **Lack of True Asset Ownership:** Centralised platforms retain control over user assets, limiting their freedom and security.

- **User Adoption of Web2 users:** Bringing users to web3 and complexity of using wallet first time is kinda difficult for web2 users.

- **No Social Layer** → No live streaming, no community chat, no collaborative experience.  

## Solution

APT-Casino addresses these problems by offering:
- **Provably Fair Gaming:** Utilising on-chain randomness and verifiable outcomes on **Solana** and **Aptos**, ensuring game results are transparent and auditable.

![APT-Casino - Analog pptx (3)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6880e1cb-769c-4272-8b66-686a90abf3be)


- **Low Fees:** Leveraging efficient L1 blockchains to minimise transaction costs.

- **Flexible Withdrawal Policies:** Providing users with clearer access to their funds (with configurable platform fees documented in `.env.example`).

- **Transparent Bonus Schemes:** Clear and clean terms without hidden traps.

- **True Asset Ownership:** Decentralised asset management ensures users have full control over their assets.

- **Seamless wallet creation** Login via keyless login wallet which offers sign in option with GOOGLE and APPLE option + Petra Wallet (Aptos) and Solana wallet adapters.

- **Fully Gasless and Zero Requirement of Confirming Transactions:** Our Users does not require the user to pay gas fees, it's paid by our treasury address to approve a single transaction we do it all, they can just play as of they are playing in their web2 platforms.

- **Live Streaming Integration** → Built with **Livepeer**, enabling real-time game streams, tournaments, and live dealer interaction on `/live`.  

- **On-Chain Chat** → Socket.IO + wallet-signed messages ensure verifiable, real-time communication between players.  

- **ROI Share Links** → Every withdrawal (profit or loss) generates a **shareable proof-link** that renders a dynamic card (similar to Binance Futures PnL cards) when posted on X.  

- **Demo mode** → Play without connecting a wallet; default **100 native units** (e.g. 100 SOL) with one-click refill (`NEXT_PUBLIC_DEMO_START_NATIVE`).

- **Mobile-first web UI** → All four games (Roulette, Mines, Plinko, Spin Wheel) are usable on phone viewports; roulette uses a horizontal scroll table on small screens.

3. **User-Friendly Interface:** An intuitive and secure interface for managing funds, placing bets, and interacting with games.
4. **Diverse Game Selection:** A variety of games, including roulette, mines, plinko, and spin wheel. As a (POC) Proof of Concept, developed 4 games but similar model can be applied to introduce new casino games to the platform.
5. **Seamless wallet creation** Login via our keyless login wallet which offers sign in option with GOOGLE and APPLE option + Petra Wallet.
6. **Fully Gasless and Zero Requirement of Confirming Transactions:** Our Users does not require the user to pay gas fees, it's paid by our treasury address to approve a single transaction we do it all, they can just play as of they are playing in their web2 platforms.
7. **Real-Time Updates**: Live game state and balance updates
8. **Event System**: Comprehensive event tracking for all game actions
9. **Social Layer** → Live streaming, on-chain chat, and NFT-based player profiles.
10. **Multichain play** → **Solana** is the default live chain; Aptos Move contracts and additional chains are registered in `src/lib/chains/registry.ts`.
11. **House balance ledger** → Supabase-backed `user_house_balances` with on-chain deposit/withdraw verification.
12. **Admin dashboard** → Ops tools for withdrawals, streams, bans, and analytics (server-gated).
13. **Promotions engine** → Admin-created coupon credits + deposit deals with audit logs and anti-abuse controls.
14. **KOL portal upgrades** → Self-service password reset and expanded earnings surfaces.
15. **$APTC public IPO** → Fixed-price SOL → APTC sale at [`/ipo`](https://aptcasino.fun/ipo) (split SOL collector + APTC distributor wallets, 3-level affiliates, 30d auto-stake @ 30% APY, Raydium post-sale).
16. **Provably fair verify** → On-site proof checker at [`/fairness/verify`](https://aptcasino.fun/fairness/verify).

## Demo mode

Enable demo play from the wallet menu without connecting a wallet. Starting balance defaults to **100** native units per chain (`NEXT_PUBLIC_DEMO_START_NATIVE`). Use **Refill demo balance** to reset. Demo state persists in `localStorage` per chain.

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> Connected: Wallet connected
    [*] --> DemoOff: No wallet

    DemoOff --> DemoOn: Enable demo mode
    DemoOn --> Playing: 100 native units credited

    Playing --> Refilled: Refill demo balance
    Refilled --> Playing: Reset to 100 units
    DemoOn --> DemoOff: Disable demo or connect wallet
    Connected --> PlayingLive: Deposit and on-chain ledger
```

## 🔐 Security

### On-Chain Randomness
All games use verifiable randomness derived from:
- Block timestamp
- Transaction hash
- Player address
- Nonce values

### Provably Fair
- Game logic and proofs are auditable per chain
- Randomness is verifiable
- Supabase stores fairness proof fields when migrations are applied

### Smart Contract Security
- Reentrancy protection
- Input validation
- Proper error handling
- Event logging for transparency

### Operational
- Server routes hold treasury keys; never expose `TREASURY_PRIVATE_KEY` or `SOL_TREASURY_SECRET_KEY` to the client
- Withdrawals above thresholds may require manual approval (`WITHDRAW_APPROVAL_BEARER`)
- Review `BANNED_WALLET_ADDRESSES` and Supabase ban tables for compliance tooling
